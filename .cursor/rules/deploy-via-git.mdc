# Wishbee Deployment

**Always deploy Wishbee to production via Git.**

- Do **not** use `vercel --prod` or Vercel CLI for deployment
- Deployment is triggered by pushing commits to the connected Git branch (e.g. `main`)
- Vercel auto-deploys when changes are pushed to the linked repository

## Deployment Steps

1. Commit changes: `git add .` and `git commit -m "Your message"`
2. Push to the production branch: `git push origin main` (or your configured branch)
3. Vercel will automatically build and deploy

When asked to deploy, instruct the user to push to Git—do not run `npm run deploy` or `vercel --prod`.
